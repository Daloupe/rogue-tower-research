# Research Labs

## Description
This mod allows you to turn houses in to research labs. Instead of generating money you can assign the house to research. While a tower is being researched it's range is halved, so keep that in mind when you have 2 houses using the same tower!

## Rules
* Houses can only research tower upgrades
* Houses research upgrades related to the adjacent towers
* Adjacent towers currently being researched have their range halved
* Each tech costs 45 research points
* Each house generates research points equal the the sum of the levels of the adjacent towers related to that tech
* Houses don't generate money while researching
* Research can be cancelled, but all research points are lost
* Technologies currently being researched are taken out of the upgrade pool
