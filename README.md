# Research Labs

## Description
This mod allows you to turn houses in to research labs. Instead of generating money you can assign the house to research, but while a tower is being researched it's range is halved.

The aim of this mod is to allow for more diverse builds without unbalancing things too much, so if you find it's making things too easy head over the the github and let me know your thoughts!

## Rules
* Houses can only research tower upgrades
* Houses research upgrades related to the adjacent towers
* Adjacent towers currently being researched have their range halved
* Each tech costs 45 research points
* Each house generates research points equal the the sum of the levels of the adjacent towers related to that tech
* Houses don't generate money while researching
* Research can be cancelled, but all research points are lost
* Technologies currently being researched are taken out of the upgrade pool

## Change Log
