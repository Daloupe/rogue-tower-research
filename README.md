# rogue-tower-research

* Houses can only research tower upgrades
* Houses research upgrades related to the adjacent towers
* Adjacent towers currently being researched have their range halved
* Each tech costs 45 research points
* Each house generates research points equal the the sum of the levels of the adjacent towers related to that tech
* Houses don't generate money while researching
* Research can be cancelled, but all research points are lost
* Technologies currently being researched are taken out of the upgrade pool
